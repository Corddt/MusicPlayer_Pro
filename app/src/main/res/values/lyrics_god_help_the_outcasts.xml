I don\'t know if You can hear me\n
Or if You\'re even there\n
I don\'t know if You would listen\n
To a gypsy\'s prayer\n\n
Yes, I know I\'m just an outcast\n
I shouldn\'t speak to You\n
Still I see Your face and wonder\n
Were You once an outcast too?\n\n
God help the outcasts\n
Hungry from birth\n
Show them the mercy\n
They don\'t find on earth\n\n
The lost and forgotten\n
They look to You still\n
God help the outcasts\n
Or nobody will\n\n
I ask for wealth, I ask for fame\n
I ask for glory to rise on my name\n
I ask for all I can possess\n
I ask for God and the angels to bless me\n\n
I ask for nothing\n
I can get by\n
But I know so many\n
Less lucky than I\n\n
God help the outcasts\n
The poor and downtrod\n
I thought we all were\n
The children of God\n\n
I don\'t know if there\'s a reason\n
Why some are blessed, some not\n
Why the few You seem to favor\n
They fear us, flee us, try not to see us\n\n
God help the outcasts\n
The tattered, the torn\n
Seeking an answer\n
To why they were born\n\n
Winds of misfortune\n
Have blown them about\n
You made the outcasts\n
Don\'t cast them out\n\n
The poor and unlucky\n
The weak and the odd\n
I thought they all were\n
The children of God\n

我不知道你是否能听见我\n
或者你是否在那里\n
我不知道你是否会倾听\n
一个吉普赛人的祈祷\n\n
是的，我知道我只是一个被遗弃者\n
我不应该对你说话\n
但我仍看着你的脸，想知道\n
你是否也曾是一个被遗弃者？\n\n
上帝帮助那些被遗弃者\n
从出生就饥饿\n
给他们展示你在地球上找不到的怜悯\n\n
那些迷失和被遗忘的人\n
仍然在寻找你\n
上帝帮助那些被遗弃者\n
否则没人会帮助他们\n\n
我寻求财富，我寻求名声\n
我寻求在我的名字上升起荣耀\n
我寻求我能拥有的一切\n
我请求上帝和天使保佑我\n\n
我什么也不求\n
我能自己应付\n
但我知道很多人\n
没有我这么幸运\n\n
上帝帮助那些被遗弃者\n
穷人和受压迫者\n
我以为我们都是\n
上帝的孩子\n\n
我不知道是否有理由\n
为什么有些人被祝福，有些人不\n
为什么你似乎偏爱的那少数人\n
害怕我们，逃避我们，尽量不去看我们\n\n
上帝帮助那些被遗弃者\n
破烂不堪，四分五裂的人\n
寻找为什么他们会出生的答案\n\n
不幸的风\n
把他们吹得到处是\n
你创造了被遗弃者\n
不要抛弃他们\n\n
那些贫穷和不幸的人\n
弱者和古怪的人\n
我以为他们都是\n
上帝的孩子\n
