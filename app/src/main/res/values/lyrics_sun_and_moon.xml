            You are sunlight and I moon\n
Joined by the gods of fortune\n
Midnight and high noon\n
Sharing the sky\n
We have been blessed, you and I\n
You are here like a mystery\n
I\'m from a world that\'s so different\n
From all that you are\n
How in the light of one night\n
Did we come so far?\n
Outside day starts to dawn\n
Your moon still floats on high\n
The birds awake\n
The stars shine too\n
My hands still shake\n
I reach for you\n
And we meet in the sky!\n
You are sunlight and I moon\n
Joined here\n
Bright\'ning the sky\n
With the flame\n
Of love\n
Made of\n
Sunlight\n
Moonlight\n

        你是温暖的阳光，而我是幽淡的月\n
由命运之神共同编织\n
午夜与高午，交织时空\n
在同一片天际共舞\n
我们被祝福，你我同在\n
你如迷雾般神秘降临\n
我来自一个与你迥异的世界\n
在一夜之光中，我们怎得相逢如此远？\n\n
黎明唤醒了世界的起始\n
你的月光依旧在高处徘徊\n
鸟儿开始唤醒晨曦\n
星辰亦在闪耀\n
我的双手仍颤抖不已\n
伸向你的温暖\n
在天际我们相遇，相融！\n\n
你是阳光，我是月亮\n
在这里相汇\n
共同点亮\n
用爱之焰\n
照耀苍穹\n
那是由\n
阳光之热\n
月光之柔\n
编织成的爱情之歌\n
