            On my own\n
Pretending he\'s beside me\n
All alone\n
I walk with him \'til morning\n
Without him, I feel his arms around me\n
And when I lose my way, I close my eyes and he has found me\n
In the rain\n
The pavement shines like silver\n
All the lights are misty in the river\n
In the darkness, the trees are full of starlight\n
And all I see is him and me forever and forever\n\n
And I know it\'s only in my mind\n
That I\'m talking to myself and not to him\n
And although I know that he is blind\n
Still I say there\'s a way for us\n\n
I love him\n
But when the night is over\n
He is gone\n
The river\'s just a river\n
Without him, the world around me changes\n
The trees are bare and everywhere the streets are full of strangers\n\n
I love him\n
But every day I\'m learning\n
All my life I\'ve only been pretending\n
Without me, his world will go on turning\n
The world is full of happiness that I have never known\n\n
I love him\n
I love him\n
I love him\n
But only on my own\n

        独自一人\n
假装他就在我身边\n
孤独地\n
我与他同行直到天亮\n
没有他，我感觉他的臂弯环绕着我\n
当我迷失方向时，我闭上眼睛，他就找到了我\n
在雨中\n
人行道像银子一样闪耀\n
所有的灯光在河中显得朦胧\n
在黑暗中，树木充满星光\n
我所看到的只有他和我，永远永远\n\n
我知道这只是我心中的想象\n
我在自言自语，并非对他说\n
虽然我知道他是盲目的\n
但我仍然说我们有一条路可走\n\n
我爱他\n
但当夜幕降临时\n
他不见了\n
河流只是一条河流\n
没有他，我周围的世界变了\n
树木光秃，到处都是陌生的街道\n\n
我爱他\n
但每一天我都在学习\n
我一生都只是在假装\n
没有我，他的世界依然转动\n
这个世界充满了我从未知晓的幸福\n\n
我爱他\n
我爱他\n
我爱他\n
但只是独自一人\n
