            Dancing bears, painted wings\n
Things I almost remember\n
And a song someone sings\n
Once upon a December\n\n
Someone holds me safe and warm\n
Horses prance through a silver storm\n
Figures dancing gracefully\n
Across my memory\n\n
Far away, long ago\n
Glowing dim as an ember\n
Things my heart used to know\n
Once upon a December\n\n
Someone holds me safe and warm\n
Horses prance through a silver storm\n
Figures dancing gracefully\n
Across my memory\n\n
Far away, long ago\n
Glowing dim as an ember\n
Things my heart used to know\n
Things it yearns to remember\n\n
And a song someone sings\n
Once upon a December\n

起舞的熊\n
彩绘的翼\n
我依稀记得\n
还有某人\n
唱过的曲\n
在那年十二月\n
那人的怀 温暖安宁\n
骏马奔腾穿越银色风暴\n
那人翩然起舞\n
在我记忆深处\n\n
(Ah...)\n\n
那人的怀 温暖安宁\n
骏马奔腾穿越银色风暴\n
有人翩然起舞\n
在我记忆深处\n
遥远之处\n
许久之前\n
如余烬般闪着微光\n
那些我内心\n
曾知晓的\n
那些它呼唤着记起的\n
还有一首\n
某人唱过的曲\n
在那年十二月\n
