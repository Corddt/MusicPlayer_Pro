### Project Name: MusicPlayer_Pro

### Project Overview
MusicPlayer_Pro is an Android music player application that provides features like music playback and lyrics display. The app offers a user-friendly interface for users to enjoy their music playback experience.

### Key Features
1. **Music Playback**: Users can play and pause music and control the playback progress using a progress bar.
2. **Lyrics Display**: The application provides a dedicated interface for displaying lyrics, with lyrics for each song defined in a separate resource file.
3. **Custom Circular Image View**: The app includes a custom `CircleImageView` class for displaying images in a circular manner, such as album covers.

### How to Use
- **Music Playback**: In the `MusicActivity`, users can control music playback and pause by using the play button. The progress bar displays the current playback progress, and users can change the playback position by dragging the progress bar.
- **View Lyrics**: To view the lyrics of the currently playing song, you can click on the rotating image in the music playback interface. This will navigate to the `LyricsActivity`, where users can see the lyrics for the currently playing song.

### Future Plans
In the future, we plan to make the following two significant modifications and feature enhancements to MusicPlayer_Pro:

- [ ] **Audio Recognition and Auto-Generated Lyrics**: We plan to add audio recognition functionality, allowing the app to automatically recognize audio content and convert it into lyrics. This will provide users with more ways to interact with audio.

- [ ] **Language Conversion and Translation**: We plan to add a language conversion button, enabling users to easily perform language conversion and translation. This will help users overcome language barriers and better understand and enjoy music.

These future plans will further enhance the functionality and user experience of MusicPlayer_Pro. Stay tuned for updates on the progress of these features.
